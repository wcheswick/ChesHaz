<h1>ChesHaz</h1>

This app contains a database of the four-digit UN/NA hazard numbers found
on various chemical shipping containers.  Our family has an interest in chemistry,
and this app provides an easy, self-contained database of chemical information.
<p>

Please note that, while we try to maintain current, accurate information, this app
should be used for educational purposes only.  <b>If you are a first responder, you
should probably use one of the available official apps</b> to access data
in emergency situations.
<p>

But just in case you need it, a swipe left will present a page pointing to
current official sources from the US government for the given chemical.
Unlike the main page, these require network access.
<p>

Suggestions are welcome.
